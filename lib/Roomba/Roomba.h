/// \mainpage Roomba library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino Roomba library.
/// It provides an object-oriented interface for talking to iRobot Roomba and Create robots
/// via a serial port.
/// The Roomba is the original device from iRobot. It has a serial port DIN socket on the side.
/// The Create is a more full-featured robot platform for hobbyists. It has both the DIN socket and a DB25
/// connector called the CArgo Bay Connector
///
/// The Create understands a superset of the Roomba commands. This library supports both devices. Where 
/// comands are only available on one or the other platform it is noted.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/Roomba/Roomba-1.3.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/Roomba
///
/// Tested on Arduino Duemilanove, Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0018 on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15,
/// cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.
///
/// A number of example programs are included that work with the iRobot Create:
/// \li TestSuite Runs on a Mega and exercises a number of the functions, checking for correct operation
/// \li RoombaTest1 Runs in any Arduino, checks that sensors can be read from Create using the stream() command
/// \li RoombaRCRx Demo program that shows how to control a Create using the RCRx Arduino library,
/// an Arduino WiFi shield such as BlackWidow and the RCTx 
/// iPhone app. Control a Create from your iPhone!
///
/// A video domonstating this library (along with the http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RCKit library)
/// being used to control a Create from an iPhone or iPad can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-5ZOb5WW4

/// \class Roomba Roomba.h <Roomba.h>
/// \brief Support for iRobot Roomba and Create platforms via serial port using the iRobot Open Interface (OI)
/// protocol.
///
/// The iRobot Roomba and Create platforms support a serial port through which you can control and 
/// interrogate the device. The protocol implemented here conforms to the Open Interface protocol described in the 
/// iRobot Open Interface Command Reference. Not all commands are supported on both platforms. Differences are
/// noted in the API
///
/// The Roomba and Create is equipped with a min-din serial port socket, while the Create
/// is also equipped with a 25-pin D connector called the Cargo Bay Connector. The
/// pins on the Cargo Bay Connector include the serial port, battery, digital inputs and
/// outputs, and an analog input.
///
/// In order to communicate with a Roomba, you must create an instance of the Roomba class and then call its 
/// instance methods to send commmands and receive sensor messages. You can also request continuous 
/// streams of sensor data to be sent by the Roomba. The Roomba also emits messages on its 
/// serial port from time to time as described below.
///
/// \par Electrical Considerations
///
/// The serial port output TXD from the Roomba/Create is too weak to drive the RX serial port input 
/// of an Arduino properly.
/// This is because of the USB-Serial converter on the Arduino: it also tries to drive the RX serial port input
/// via a pullup resistor, 
/// but the Roomba does not have enough drive to pull the RX down below about 2.5 volts, which is insufficient 
/// to be reliably detected as a TTL serial input of 0.
///
/// \note Note that this problem does not affect the Serial1 Serial2 or Serial3 ports on the Mega: these ports do not 
/// have other circuitry connected to them and the Roomba can drive the serial port inputs of these ports 
/// without a problem. Its only the RX Serial port (ie the first Serial port) that is affected by this problem. 
///
/// What this means is that if you intend to connect a Roomba to the standard (first) RX/TX serial port on an Arduino 
/// you \a MUST have additional circuitry to help drive RX on the Arduino low enough. 
/// We use a simple PNP emitter follower. Almost any small signal low power PNP will do.
/// See the <a href="Create-Arduino.pdf">example circuit diagram</a>. This will ensure the RX serial 
/// port input on the Arduino is pulled down to about 0.6V for reliable comms.
///
/// \par Other Roomba messages
///
/// When iRobot Create powers up and after a reset, it sends a message like this on its serial port:
/// \code
/// bl-start
/// 2006-09-12-1137-L   
/// RDK by iRobot!
/// MC9S12E128
/// 2006-11-20-1731-L   
/// battery-current-quiescent-raw 524  battery-current-zero 510
/// 
/// 2006-11-20-1731-L   
/// \endcode
///
/// While charging it will send a message like this each second:
/// \code
/// bat:   min 3  sec 21  mV 15558  mA 1491  deg-C 24  
/// \endcode
///
/// To enter the factory test menu for the IRobot Create, hold down the (>) and (>>|) 
/// buttons then press and hold the Power button until the assending and descending tones play and then stop. 
/// You wil see some messages emitted on teh serial port.
/// Press the right-right arrow button to cycle through the tests.
